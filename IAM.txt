IAM :-
IAM infrastructure includes the following elements:-
   Principal   
   Request 
   Authentication 
   Authorization 
   Action
   Resources

When users, groups & roles are created they are available all over the world.
New users have no permissions when first created

IAM user Arn: arn:aws:iam::accountid without hyphen:user/bob
AWS console signin link:- https://myawsaccountid.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/

Principal:- defines who is going to access aws resources
Principal can be:- 
    -Root user
    -IAM user 
    -Roles/Temporary security tokens

There are three ways that IAM authenticates a principal
   -username/password
   -IAM user
   -Accesskey/ Session Token

When a principal sends a request via console, cli, sdks or apis include following:-
   -Actions that the principal wants to perform
   -Resources upon which the actions are performed
   -principal information including the environment from which the request was made

IAM can be accessed using:- console, cli, sdk , api
Power users are those who have the full access to aws services except IAM users, groups, roles, billing


Two types of policies:-
  -Identity Based Policies (based on user, role, federated user, application.)
     1)Managed Policy
           A)AWS managed policy
           B)Customer managed policy 
     2)Inline policies
  -Resource based policies (these policies are attached to resources like s3 bucket)

Identity based policies has following elements:-
   -Effect
   -Service
   -Resource
   -Action
   -Condition

1 explicit deny will override all explicit allow in the policy 
1 explicit allow will override all implicit deny in the policy


Cross account access can be done in two ways:-
    -Assuming Roles
    -Resource based policy

Cross account access with a resource based policy has an advantage over a role , with a resource that is accessed through a resource based policy , the user still works in the trusted account and does not  have to give up his or her user permissions in place of the role permissions.



STS has multiple apis to request session token (temporary security credentials)
   -AssumeRole
     Who can call:- IAM user or user with existing temporary security credentials
   -AssumeRolewithSAML
      Who can call:- caller must pass a SAML authentication response that indicates authentication from a known identity provider
   -AssumeRolewithWebIdentities
      Who can call:-Any user , caller must pass a web identity token that indicates authentication form a known identity provider.
   -GetSessionToken 
      Who can call:-IAM user or AWS account root user
   -GetFederationToken
      Who can call:- IAM users or aws account root user


There are two ways to assume a role
   - Interactively in the IAM console
   - Programmatically with the AWS CLI 

IAM role delegation :- To delegate permission to access a resource you create an IAM role that has two policies attached
   - permission policy where action & resources the role can assumed are defined.
   - trust policy specifies which trusted accounts are allowed to grant its user permissions to assume the role.
