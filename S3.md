       - Bucket Policies
       - ACL
          - Bucket ACL
          - Object ACL
          
 ## When to use
    - Object ACLS: An object ACL is the only way to manage access to objects not owned by the bucket owner.
    - Bucket ACLS: The only recommended use case for bucket acl is to grant write permission to Amazon S3 log delivery group to write access logs objects to your bucket.
    - Bucket Policies: if an aws account that owns a bucket wants to grant permission to users in its account, it can use either a bucket policy or a user policy . For cross account permissions when you want to provide another account full s3 permissions, you can do that via bucket policy.
